# Google Summer of Code 2020 @Â Zulip - Project Report

I've never been a blog person but as my GSoC concludes, it's the best time to do a write-up about how I started, what I experienced, and what I loved about and gained from the program.

My project was primarily oriented towars making Zulip's desktop client a better overall in terms of UX and features.
I worked with my mentors [Abhigyan Khaund](github.com/abhigyank) and [Akash Nimare](github.com/akashnimare), who were readily available throughout my GSoC period,
to work on the high priority issues as Zulip is an end-user centric product and we want our users to have the best experience.
